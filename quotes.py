        "I am fire and life incarnate! Now and forever — I am Phoenix!",
        "If even one more person died at my hands…It's better this way. Quick. Clean. Final. I love you, Scott. A part of me will always be with you.",
        "I am what was, what is, what will be — the black angel, Chaos-Bringer! I AM POWER!",
        "Finish me with your claws. I beg you. I don't want to HURT YOU!!",
        "I…hunger, Scott — for a joy, a rapture. Beyond all comprehension. That need is a part of me, too.",
        "But the fire of the Phoenix burns through lies, you understand? The gaze of the Phoenix is like an x-ray tearing through every self-deception. So burn, Emma!",
        "Scott, am i worth it? I destroyed a world–in my mind, I can still hear the screams of the dying–and it felt good! I don't want that feeling ever again. And yet–I do!",
        "And you're Emma Frost–The Hellfire Club's White Queen. I understand you call yourself something of a telepath. Well, 'Your Majesty.' Let's see how good you really are.",
        "Jean to Phoenix to Dark Phoenix–a progression as inevitable as death.",
        "Open your eyes, Scott. Nothing will happen. I'm telekinetically keep your optic blasts in check. I…wanted to see your face, that's all. You have a good face.",
        "You and I are quits now, X-men. Our paths will cross no more. My destiny lies in the stars.",
        "We come into this world alone, and we leave the same way, the time we spend in between ... time spent alive, sharing, learning ... together ... is all that makes life worth living.",
        "Who are we? Are we simply what others want us to be? Are we destined to a fate beyond our control? Or can we evolve, become something more?"
